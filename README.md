ARIMA-And-Seasonal-ARIMA: Predicting Champagne Sales

As a data analyst at a leading beverage company, we have been tasked with predicting the sales of Champagne over time to optimize production, inventory management, and marketing strategies. Historical sales data is available, but it exhibits trends and seasonal fluctuations, making it challenging to forecast future sales accurately.To solve this problem, we aim to use ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Seasonal-ARIMA (SARIMA) models to predict future Champagne sales, considering both the trend and seasonality components. By analyzing past sales data, we will build robust forecasting models that can accurately capture the underlying patterns and provide actionable insights for business planning.The key objectives of this project are:
To analyze historical Champagne sales data for patterns and seasonality.
To build an ARIMA model for non-seasonal forecasting and a Seasonal-ARIMA model to account for seasonal variations in sales.
To evaluate the accuracy of the models in predicting future sales, helping the company plan production and distribution strategies effectively.
